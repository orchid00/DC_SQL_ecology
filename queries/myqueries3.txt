-- JOINS

-- So far we have been working with one table, but most of the
-- time we need to work with more than one

-- To combine data from two tables we use the SQL JOIN command, which comes after the FROM command.
-- The JOIN command on its own will result in a cross product, where each row in the 
-- first table is paired with each row in the second table
-- need to tell the computer which columns provide the link between the two tables using the word ON. 

-- what we want is to join the data with the same species id.
SELECT *
FROM surveys
JOIN species
ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id;

-- ON is like WHERE, it filters things out according to a test condition
-- We use the table.colname format to which table we are referring to.

-- Alternative we can use the verb USING
SELECT *
FROM surveys
JOIN species
USING (species_id);

-- we can select some columns
SELECT surveys.year, surveys.month, surveys.day, species.genus, species.species
FROM surveys
JOIN species
ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id;

-- Challenge
SELECT species.genus, species.species, surveys.weight
FROM surveys
JOIN species
ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id
WHERE weight != '';

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM surveys
JOIN species
USING (species_id);

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM surveys;

-- by default, SQL only returns records where the joining value is present in the joined 
-- columns of both tables (i.e. it takes the intersection of the two join columns). 
-- this is also a short cut for INNER JOIN

-- Other JOINS
-- We can also tell the computer that we wish to keep all the records in the first table by using the command 
-- LEFT JOIN .

-- Challenge
-- Re-write the original query to keep all the entries present in the surveys table. 
-- How many records are returned by this query?
SELECT * 
FROM surveys
LEFT JOIN species
USING (species_id);

-- Let's dive in into a longer query
-- Calculate average mass of the individuals on each different plot_type

SELECT plots.plot_type, AVG(surveys.weight)
FROM surveys
JOIN plots
ON surveys.plot_id = plots.plot_id
GROUP BY plots.plot_type;

-- Challenge
-- What is the average weight of each Rodent species over the course of the years? 
-- Is there any noticeable trend for any of the species?

SELECT surveys.species_id, year, AVG(weight) as mean_weight
FROM surveys 
JOIN species 
ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id 
WHERE taxa = 'Rodent'
GROUP BY surveys.species_id, year;
